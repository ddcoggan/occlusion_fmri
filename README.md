Analysis pipeline for fMRI experiments and computational control analyses, currently under review at Cerebral Cortex.

The data are available from Dryad at DOI: 10.5061/dryad.5tb2rbpg1. The repository contains these files plus data from the two fMRI experiments and freesurfer subjects directories, which are contained in additional top-level directories named 'exp1', 'exp2', and 'freesurfer', respectively.

The entire fMRI analysis pipeline can be performed by running 'fMRI_pipeline.py'. The computational control analyses can be performed by running 'control/control/VOneNet/VOneNet_pipeline.py'. This requires Python 3.8 with the packages listed in requirements.txt installed.

Stimuli for both experiments are contained in 'exp1/stimuli/images'
